# R

The packages for OnDemand (rocker/rstudio): `/mmfs1/gscratch/stergachislab/claflamm/bin/ondemand/R/library`


Installed R on klone/hyak using miniconda: `/mmfs1/gscratch/stergachislab/claflamm/bin/miniconda3/`

# Installing executables to utilize software tools
First, download the linux executable file
```
wget <link_address>
```
Note: make sure you copy the link address from "raw," not the HTML link from the browser.

Then, decompress it:
```
tar -xvf <file.tar.gz>
```


Then, navigate into the unzipped folder, find the executable, `md5sum` check, and move it into the install location in PATH (/mmfs1/gscratch/stergachislab/claflamm/bin).
Finally, check the install: 
```
app_name -h
```
